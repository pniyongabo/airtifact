# AIRTIFACT

AIRTIFACT is an open-source platform designed to facilitate sharing and collaboration on AI artifacts, such as code, datasets, media, and interactive visualizations. Built using modern web technologies like React and Next.js, the platform is aimed at AI practitioners, researchers, and students to promote open collaboration and knowledge exchange.

## Features
- **AI-assisted layout design**: The platform uses AI to optimize image and text content layouts.
- **Image generation**: Generate images with the help of the Midjourney API.
- **Automated deployment**: Powered by Vercel for easy deployment and firewall protection.
  
### MVP Completed:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and created using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To get started, follow the steps below:

### Run the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

This project also uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
